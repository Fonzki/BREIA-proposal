# Website Redesign Proposal: Baltimore Real Estate Investors Association
A semi-responsive dummy homepage I designed as a PSD and brought to life with HTML/CSS/SASS

## How to Run
1. Clone
2. Open index.html

## Points of Interest
- Layout breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, 665px, 425px (Hamburger menu not functional)
- Compare to the original https://www.baltimorereia.com/
